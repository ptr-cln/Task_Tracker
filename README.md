# Angular Task Tracker App

This is my first project with <b>TypeScript</b>/<b>Angular</b>. <br>
I'm just studying these technologies and I chose to make a little project, because I'm a geek :robot: <br>

So, the app uses TypeScript/Angular as Front-End and a Json Server as "Fake Back-End"

This is how the app works (I prefer GIFs to videos :smile:) : <br>

```

### Run the JSON server (http://localhost:5000)
